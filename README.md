# Digit_recog_algo_comparison
In this project I tried to compare the performance of 3 different methods for handwritten digit recognition.
A SVM model with kernel of 9th order, gamma  = 0.01 and cost = 1000 gave me a test set accuracy of 95.24%.
A Neural net model with rectifier activation gave a test set accuracy of 97.41%.
A SVM model on a  PCA transformed data gave the best result of 98%.
